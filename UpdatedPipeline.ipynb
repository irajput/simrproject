cry really hope one else got really crappy gifts supposed fun like things get jerks let shake things weird wall gift received ended amazing tomorrow trying put mascara maybe eyeliner first time ever trans girl hoping hate wish luck think us would agree love important thing love care someone love care reciprocated one would think something fundamentally important love something easy understand easy give easy receive reality however many us difficulty knowing love difficulty knowing properly give receive world today love confused sex whereas sex expression love love also gets confused limerance feeling love mainly chemical hormonal response person seems desirable usually sexual way limited expression love many us know love little wonder todays movies tv music frequently portray love limerance love sex enmeshment even none represent true love rather warped context view love compound problem beyond belief many us raised parents cruel abusive physically verbally emotionally terrible scars left us make ever difficult us know love show receive especially never experienced normal love love like multifaceted diamond child supposed taught experiencing love unconditional consistent provide sense safety security feel scared engender atmosphere openness honesty sense confidence even something wrong bad helped nurtured better means definitive explanation love example many us never experienced many us love conditional inconsistent unreliable vacillating appeared love knew could turn worst abuse love never provided true sense safety something wrong bad generally confidence would abused sort environment abused infants children know abused infant child formed conclusions fundamental level started believe deserve know wrong started believe must also something seriously wrong us feel ashamed guilty needs wants made feel ashamed guilty many us feeling love behaving manner got parents approval learned young age think feel want important way parents perceived truthful important safe honest vulnerable seen opportunity shown love help nurturing highly likely situation abuse early teens start experience feelings romantic young minds still know normal love know parents incapable giving us love need start fantasize idealize romantic love minds thing heal deep wounds cut subconscious minds believing need another person undo emotional psychological wounds carry children teenagers introduced concept love music tv movies influences warp sense love something like sex enmeshment codependency though love pinnacle love ultimate validation self worth little wonder relationships last years let alone decades many us start life handicap usually large portion life devoted figuring hell went wrong lives great deal us find process far confronting distressing turn drugs alcohol self destructive behaviors attempt escape dull pain one main problems cognitive behavioral therapy abuse infancy babyhood generally stored logic center brain logical reasoning alone undo much damage stored emotional fear response part brain typically associated limited fight flight however also core beliefs worthlessness unlovableness fundamental shame guilt simply needs wants young age emotions inextricably linked fear danger pain must avoided costs also us dealing issues first dealt severe denial distraction suppression minds associate vulnerabilities severe pain anguish everything avoid facing vulnerabilities cruel twist fate sabotage rest lives rarely attracted type person need fill emotional needs help us heal typically attracted people oblivious pain behave way exacerbate entrench emotional damage early childhood taught us uncertainty almost always leads taught certainty greater chance avoiding pain therefore met people could actually fill emotional needs filled uncertainty even contempt people usually quiet natured emotional afraid vulnerability valued openness things put us high alert potential danger pain repelled things subconscious associated danger subconscious associates safety ironically meet people like parents mainly interested filling needs people talk vulnerable emotions people put good things mind attracted familiar therefore feels easily slip relationships codependency relationships people pleasing validation seeking approval seeking find best use usually self centered people narcissistic tendencies people blame perpetuation abuse products childhood made attracted person meet codependent needs narcissistic tendencies one soul destroying depressing confronting truths ever face fact entire concept love never experienced love given ever given received concept love may amount sex enmeshment codependency love none true love fix problem need go back childhood everything went wrong challenge sometimes need remember back infancy babyhood abuse began unfortunately also many deepest scars made also time life retain fewest conscious go deep often need rely know parents combine know would likely happened example life young adult knew hated porridge thought activated gag reflex knew mother force fed porridge every day baby realized deeper damage mother done baby like porridge like babies spat made mother bang loudly table disapproval would yell scream hit spitting learned option swallow scream open mouth would shoved full another tablespoon porridge would even hold nose stop screaming spitting would hurry swallow could breath scream forced another table spoon porridge sad practical terms led far damage revulsion earliest memory feeling dread associated choice told implied subjugation fear consequences pain shock humiliation also contributed underdeveloped self personal preferences completely irrelevant dangerous also contributed enmeshment quickly learn accept behave exactly expected make trauma abuse end quickly possible another example childhood ca remember remember dragged bedroom ear age given solid beating belt put year olds would cried hysterically loudly inconsolably adult looking back think made mum feel like feeling bad came back room give another hiding crying another sad story practical terms child taught get punished feeling sorry effect teaching self love bad feel shame guilt even self hate personally parental abuse led feelings subjugation enmeshment underdeveloped sense led people pleasing approval seeking validation seeking behaviors well unsustainable ultimately led severe depression anxiety hard imagine many us childhood abuse debilitated self hate feelings worthlessness intense guilt shame things make us feel continuing bad things make us feel good taught price pay feeling good hell undo easily takes great deal time concentrated deliberate repeated effort even progress measured small increments undo damage first recognize appropriate response abuse child naturally expressed appropriate response crying screaming yelling throwing responses case met even greater level violent humiliating young minds choice convince appropriate response inappropriate response even dangerous response memories purely logic based stored fight flight response center brain access change logic cognitive behavioral therapy alone order access stored memory first need trigger triggering sense worthlessness unlovableness meant getting touch feeling love love unreciprocated even pain able intensify listening painful heartbreaking love songs knowing changing visceral feeling little logic meditated fact intense feeling wanting needing reciprocated desperate romantic love complete never true representation meditated fact concept truth love stolen abuse let get parents even though products abusive got angry injustice life started feel way child would naturally feel wronged first time indignant outraged angry generally pissed listened music encouraged feeling defiance outrageous abuse power leo morachioli killing name give away fairness songs feelings make feel love help wipe slate give sense justification feeling angry valid innocent needs wants met abused right happy course none us want spend rest lives angry neither want spend rest lives apologizing fact desperately unfulfilled emotional psychological scarey part allowing move uncharted waters explore person really full trust love knowing believing rise even better version ever imagined could first need willing explore parts us tried many years deny suppress distract point start start giving commendation praise validation approval every single good thing say stop giving people think know whatever said exactly right thing guaranteed people world wo care one tiny little bit making decisions saying feel need say simply love others love come place self hate self loathing low self esteem possible love left give away others basic level even believe anything good offer ca show true love others learn show true love means prepared put feelings choices preferences others without guilt shame taught feel concrete position give consistent reliable unconditional love place emptiness even done everything us may still find world less loving less nurturing less accommodating however yet another reason make sure come rock solid concrete basis knowing knowing came knowing needs wants knowing right expect life got got paycheque friday blew exception student loan paid everything everyone owed money end shopping spree left account could happier know really dumb bothers much stop posting like giving opinion got called dirty lazy suggesting maybe judge mock someone portrayed way reality tv highly edited rarely whole truth feel like replies well worded time put effort making
